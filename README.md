# Near Term Todo:
1. Make the hitbox smaller for the player
2. Telegraph enemy spawns
3. Add some more enemies
   - Add weak enemy (no contact damage, instead does a telegraphed attack)
   - Harder shooting enemy (shoots several bullets at a time, tougher)
   - A few special enemies
     - Appears, waits for a few seconds then shoots a laser, then waits and disappears.
     - Runs towards the enemy then explodes
     - Predicts where the player is going to move and shoots there
4. Create boss
    - Set bullet hell patterns probably

# Fun ideas:
1. "Fun enemy" that is much faster than you, shoots at you while remaining away from the 4 cardinal directions.
2. Press Konami code to get the grok room
3. Press secret code to turn everything back to placeholder sprites
4. Press secret code to make everything emit particles
