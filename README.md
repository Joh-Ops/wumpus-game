# Todo:
1. Make the hitbox smaller for the player
2. Telegraph enemy spawns
3. Add some more enemies
   - Add weak enemy (no contact damage, instead does a telegraphed attack)
   - Harder shooting enemy (shoots several bullets at a time, tougher)
   - A few special enemies
     - Appears, waits for a few seconds then shoots a laser, then waits and disappears.
     - Runs towards the enemy then explodes
     - Predicts where the player is going to move and shoots there
