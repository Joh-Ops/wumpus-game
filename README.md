# Near Term Todo:
1. Make the hitbox smaller for the player
2. Telegraph enemy spawns

3. Fix enemy generation

4. Add some more enemies
   - Harder shooting enemy (shoots several bullets at a time, tougher)
   - A few special enemies
     - Appears, waits for a few seconds then shoots a laser, then waits and disappears.
     - Runs towards the enemy then explodes
     - Predicts where the player is going to move and shoots there
5. Create boss
    - Set bullet hell patterns probably
    
6. Mana system + weapons
    - Every time you hit an enemy, you get 5 mana
    - Basic weapon uses 0 mana, but other weapons can use mana
        - You can hold two weapons at a time, and swap using space, pick up using e
    - Special abilities are represented by items, and you can only hold one special item at once. Press q to activate a special ability, and special abilities use a lot of mana (hundreds).
        - e.g. invincibility which drains mana extremely quickly (the rate might start at 200 mana for a second, but 400 mana for the next), hp up for a significant mana cost, damage + speed up a lot, teleport forwards which can pass through walls 
    
7. After completing a room you have a chance of getting a HP pickup or a weapon with a lower chance
    - Special treasure room that guarentees a special ability
